The Spaceship Titanic was an interstellar passenger liner launched by Kaggle in 2022. 
This is a variant of the Titanic dataset.

**Description**: With almost 13,000 passengers on board, the vessel set out on its maiden voyage transporting emigrants 
from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars.

While rounding Alpha Centauri en route to its first destination—the torrid 55 Cancri E—the unwary Spaceship Titanic 
collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud. Sadly, it met a fate similar to its namesake 
from 1000 years ago. Though the ship stayed intact, almost half the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension!

**Task**: To help rescue crews retrieve lost passengers, you are challenged to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceship’s damaged computer system.
