**IoT-BASED HEALTH MONITORING SYSTEM**

The proposed design aims to help individuals monitor their health status and assist medical personnel in monitoring and diagnosing when their patient is unwell or requires urgent medical attention. 

**FUNCTIONALITY**
1.	Incorporate the DH11 and Max30100 sensors with Raspberry Pi Pico W to take vital signs, that is, temperature, heart rate, and blood-oxygen saturation level (Sp02).
2.	Design a working and secure health monitoring system that makes users' information available to them and the medical staff via the Web.
3.	Allow users to trigger emergency emails for online/onsite urgent health support by medical staff.
